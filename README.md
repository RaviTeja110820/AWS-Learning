# AWS-Learning

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, databases,and Networking on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Cloud service models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):

In the IaaS model, AWS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It offers a high level of flexibility and control to users, who are responsible for managing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. With IaaS, you can provision and manage virtual machines, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources. AWS services like Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) fall under the IaaS category.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS):

PaaS is a cloud service model where AWS provides a platform and environment for developing, running, and managing applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. With PaaS, developers can focus on application development and deployment, while AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking. AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS Lambda are examples of PaaS offerings that simplify application deployment and serverless computing, respectively.

### Software as a Service (SaaS):

SaaS is a cloud service model where AWS delivers software applications over the internet, accessible through a web browser or APIs. In the SaaS model, users can utilize applications hosted on AWS infrastructure without the need for installation, maintenance, or management. Common examples of SaaS offerings by AWS include Amazon WorkMail (email and calendaring), Amazon Chime (online meetings and video conferencing), and Amazon QuickSight (business intelligence and analytics).
